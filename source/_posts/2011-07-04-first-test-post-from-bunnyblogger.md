Several moons ago I have been working on a special blogging client, that is capable of wysiwyg blogging and allows you to take snapshots from movie files and add images and other images to your post.

I have only shown this to a few people. But now, I've been working to bring it up to user-standard so everyone can benefit from a way to blog quickly, without the waiting for image upload messing with your writing flow.

This is a test post from that very program, entering its beta.
