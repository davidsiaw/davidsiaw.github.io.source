So I've been working on a memory pool lately as a hobby project, and I've come across some things that I haven't found a solution that would satisfy my gut yet. But, after reading this:

I started to realize that since I'm already on the internet, why not have people examine my code instead? To that effect, I'm asking everyone who's not afraid of C and actually reads this blog to comment on my code. It can be found here:

<a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~davidsiaw/bpool/trunk/annotate/head%3A/b_pool//b_pool.c">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~davidsiaw/bpool/trunk/annotate/head%3A/b_pool//b_pool.c</a>

This is the center of the code development at the moment. I'll add more comments later on how the pool is actually supposed to work. I'd like to know if there are any bad practices catchable from the outset. Thanks!
