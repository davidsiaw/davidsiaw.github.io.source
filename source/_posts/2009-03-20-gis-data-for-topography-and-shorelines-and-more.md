I've <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/topo.html">found a site </a>recently that provides data for free on the world's shorelines and topography. They have got other datasets too that aren't as complete, but would probably be of interest to those of you who wish to do research on it. For me, when I look at data like this I get the itch to write programs that process and present it. I might just do that eventually. *keeps a note to self*
