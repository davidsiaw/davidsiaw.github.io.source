After losing a few games of command and conquer and the computer blue screening when I'm just about to win, I am thoroughly convinced that contrary to their ads, Microsoft has never intended to make life easy for anyone. I swear by my keyboard I will make an OS that is actually reliable and usable by everyone someday. UURGH!
