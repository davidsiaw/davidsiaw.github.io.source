After having some browser issues, I found that I wasn't really happy with the way WordPress let me go about managing my pages. It was difficult to set the parent-child relationships between pages and doing massive changes. What I started to look around for was a blogging client that would allow me to perform all the changes I wanted on my computer, natively, and then upload the changes to WordPress. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any such thing. So I decided to comb through WordPress's XML RPC API, and start looking for ways to implement such a client.
