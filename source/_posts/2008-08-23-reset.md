I never seem to be satisfied with any of the sites I made, so I made myself swear that this is the last time I'm going to replace the Labs site. The last one was a bit of a joke anyway. If you ever have a choice, Drupal 6 isn't exactly a good CMS for building production sites, unless you have got plenty of in-house expertise. When you have to spend a whole day messing around with it to get it to let you post just one blog post, perhaps it just isn't built to write posts.

So the difference is, yes I have moved down to the Wordpress side to avoid the grief that comes with Drupal. I have decided that hacking something that works well is easier that hacking something that is borked. So I have decided that I will hack this. Woot. Now back to coding.
