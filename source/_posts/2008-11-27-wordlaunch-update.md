Some personal problems this week have delayed development but I'm not one with a faint heart! This week's project is still going. Here is version 0.1! It allows you to edit your pages, and it probably still needs a lot of work before its any good at solving my rant that started this project, but I guess this is a start.

Here's a video on what the program currently does:

(not the best video in the world, but it should illustrate what you should be clicking =P)
Theres no audio in this video, so don't worry about letting your boss hear it =)

In order to compile this project, you will need Visual Studio 2008 and the .NET framework (duh). Also, you'll need to unzip xulrunner into a folder and place it in the same directory as the binary.

Since not everyone has the priviledge of having a MSFT compiler, I'm also providing binaries as a download. But I won't be responsible if they so happen to be dodgy.
