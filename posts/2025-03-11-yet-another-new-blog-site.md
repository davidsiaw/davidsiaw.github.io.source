Once again it comes to pass that I create yet another blog site for myself. I did promise myself not to do this but [it aged like fine milk](/2008/08/23/reset). In the meantime I did learn a few new things about myself.

1. I like making blog sites
2. Existing blogging frameworks are good but they break over time.

Point 1 is straightforward. This is something I have [done repeatedly](/2013/10/12/new-blog) and will probably happen again. In the intervening time I made [my own website framework](https://davidsiaw.github.io/weaver-docs/dark/) and it is currently in use here.

I mentioned what I did not like about stuff in previous posts so I will not repeat them here. I tried a host of things ranging from Drupal to Wordpress to various static site generators like Jekyll and Octopress.

Alas I have not been satisfied with any of them. Yes I have reinvented the wheel whether you like it or not.

My new blog uses my own framework, and a very simple way to generate static pages for display. I have some made some stylistic choices and omitted anything I do not miss.

I have also removed the ability to comment on this blog. This is a big thing. Over the years I have found people do not comment mostly. Most comments sections are eventually flooded by spammers, and comment providers die out over time. A comments section is pointless for a site that I only use to take notes on. If you have something useful to say then you probably know who I am and know how to contact me.

Anyway I have made yet another new blog site as a form of self-gratification and look forward to writing more in the days to come.
