In Electrical Engineering there are many many formulas that came from people doing experiments and determining them. Wikipedia has a historical but it is not complete and a lot of things (like Lenz) are mentioned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_electrical_and_electronic_engineering.

Here I attempt to make a timeline from the point of view of the formulas or famous methods and when they were derived:

- 174x Andrew Gordon and Benjamin Franklin develop the first electric motors
- 1799 Alessandro Volta invents the voltaic pile (a battery) and produced the first steady electric current.
- 1820 André-Marie Ampère formulates Ampere's Law. theorizes the "electrodynamic molecule", or the electron.

\\[\frac{F\_m}{L} = 2k\_A\frac{I\_1 I\_2}{r}\\]

- 1826 Georg Simon Ohm discovers relationship between voltage and current, resistance and its relationship to the dimensions of the conductor

\\[R = \frac{V}{I}\\]

- 1828 George Green discovers Green's theorem

- 1831 Joseph Henry discovers self-inductance

\\[v(t) = L\frac{di}{dt} \\]

- 1831 Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry discover mutual-inductance

\\[\frac{V\_p}{V\_s} = \frac{N\_p}{N\_s} \\]

- 1832 Michael Faraday builds the first electric generator

- 1834 Heinrich Lenz formulates Lenz's law:

\\[EMF = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\\]

- 1835 Prof. William Thomson (a.k.a) Lord Kelvin wrote about capacitance. It is not clear how Q=CV came about but [this publication in the Journal of Science](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924066246632&seq=421) seems to be the closest.

\\[i(t) = C(\frac{dv}{dt}) \\]

- 1845 Gustav Kirchoff announced Kirchoff's Laws.

\\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} V\_{i} = 0 (loop) \\]

\\[\sum_{i=1}^{n} I\_{i} = 0 (node) \\]

- 1850 Lord Kelvin and George Stokes invent Stokes' Theorem

- 1853 Hermann von Helmholtz derives Thevenin's Theorem
- 1853 Lord Kelvin showed that discharge between Leyden Jars and a self-inductive device should be oscillatory, and derived its resonant frequency.

\\[f\_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}\\]

- 1862 James Clerk Maxwell publishes his famous laws, albeit not in their modern form shown here:

\\[\nabla \cdot \textbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon\_0}\\]

\\[\nabla \cdot \textbf{B} = 0\\]

\\[\nabla \times \textbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\textbf{B}}{\partial t}\\]

\\[\nabla \cdot \textbf{B} = \mu\_0(\textbf{J} + \epsilon\_0\\frac{\partial\textbf{E}}{\partial t})\\]

- 1872 Lork Kelvin coins the term permeability, relating magnetic flux density to magnetic field

\\[\textbf{B} = \mu \textbf{H} \\]

- 1879 Walter Baily built the first AC induction motor

- 1880 Oliver Heaviside introduces electrical permittivity, relating displacement field to electric field

\\[\textbf{D} = \epsilon \textbf{E} \\]

- 1884 Oliver Heaviside calls the coefficient of self-induction, simply *inductance*
- 1884 John Henry Poynting derives the Poynting vector, showing the directional energy flux

\\[\textbf{S} = \textbf{E} \times \textbf{H}\\]

- 1898 John Ambrose Fleming publishes a book with the Left and Right hand rules of electromagnetism

- 1897 Sir Joseph John Thomson discovers the electron.
- 1926 Hans Ferdinand Mayer and Edward Lawry Norton derived Norton's Law
- 1971 Leon Chua theorizes the final fundamental component, the memristor

\\[M(q) = \frac{d\phi\_m}{dq}\\]
