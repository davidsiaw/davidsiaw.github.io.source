I've finally gotten my long-awaited new keyboard. Up until now I was using a PS/2 Keyboard with the brand A4 or something that came with a computer I bought 4 years ago. Don't get me wrong, it was a great keyboard, or I would have changed it in a Jiffy. Most flashy keyboards like the diNovo edge or the other flashy LED keyboards were pretty but never enticed me. Not too long ago however, my eyes were laid on a beautiful labelless keyboard on youtube. It was love at first sight...
